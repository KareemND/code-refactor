# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
The objective of this webpage is to employ all the tools that was taught in the first module.

The code was refactored to make it simpler and more accessible.

This was an opportunity to apply my knowledge in html,css, and the git work-flow.

All the links are functional, the proper semantic elements were added, and I commented on the changes I made to make the code clearer.
